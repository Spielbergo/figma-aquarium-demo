## About the Project

This project is a pixel-perfect recreation of a Figma design for **Annerley Aquarium**, a Brisbane-based family-owned aquarium specialist. Every section was built to match the Figma comps in layout, typography, colour, and spacing — without using any CSS frameworks or UI libraries.

The goal: demonstrate the ability to take a Figma file and ship clean, accessible, production-quality front-end code — exactly the skill set required for Figma-to-website jobs.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — semantic, accessible markup (ARIA roles, skip link, `aria-label`, `role="list"` etc.)
- **CSS3** — custom properties, CSS Grid, Flexbox, `clamp()`, media queries, gradient text
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — mobile nav drawer, product carousel, form validation, active nav highlighting, dynamic footer year
- **Google Fonts** — DM Sans
- **SVG** — inline rainbow-gradient logo mark, arrow icons

---

## Key Implementation Details

- **Zero dependencies** — no Bootstrap, Tailwind, jQuery, or any third-party CSS/JS
- **CSS custom properties** for the full design token system (colours, spacing, radii, font sizes, font weights)
- **Rainbow gradient text** via `-webkit-background-clip: text` — used consistently across headings
- **CSS Grid** for the Exclusive Offer, Reviews, Contact, and Footer layouts
- **Responsive** — mobile-first breakpoints at `480px`, `768px`, and `1024px`
- **Accessible** — keyboard navigable, ARIA attributes, semantic HTML throughout
- **SEO ready** — `<title>`, meta description, Open Graph, Twitter Card, Schema.org JSON-LD, canonical URL

## Local Development

No build step required — it's pure static HTML/CSS/JS.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aquarium-website.git
cd aquarium-website

# Serve with Python (or any static server)
python -m http.server 5500
```

Then open [http://localhost:5500](http://localhost:5500) in your browser.
